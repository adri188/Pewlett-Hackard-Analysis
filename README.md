## Summary

- PH is definitely facing a challenge as there are 72458 roles that will be retiring. However there is a chance that not all the roles require backfill as technology and industry could have become more efficient. So an analysis will need to be performed on this area 

- As of the mentorship program. Looks like we have 1549 eligible employees to participate, and might not be enough given the numbers of new next generation to come.
